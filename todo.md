# Scheduled Tasks Feature
- [ ] Align UX entry point (slash command vs App Home) and enable interactivity settings.
- [ ] Update `slack-app-manifest.yaml` for any new scopes or commands/shortcuts.
- [ ] Add schedule data model + persistence (`src/store/scheduleStore.ts`, `.alfred/scheduledjobs.json`).
- [ ] Ensure `.alfred/` lives in the workspace and is created on startup if missing.
- [ ] Build schedule computation utilities (next run calculation, timezone handling).
- [ ] Implement scheduler service (poll loop, due task execution, retries, dedupe).
- [ ] Add modal view + `view_submission` handler for schedule creation and validation.
- [ ] Use `conversations_select` for channel selection and store channel IDs.
- [ ] Post scheduled root messages with Alfred mention and instruction; create thread mappings.
- [ ] Decide on Codex execution path for scheduled runs (direct invoke vs synthetic mention) and implement.
- [ ] Implement full CRUD for schedules (list, create, update, delete) — required.
- [ ] Add tests: schedule calculations, store persistence, scheduler loop, Slack posting contract.
- [ ] Update docs (`spec.md`, README) to reflect scheduling support and constraints.
